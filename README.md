## 🧬 Biological & Scientific Focus
- Analysis of biological and experimental data  
- Spatial patterns in biological systems  
- Integration of biological data with environmental and spatial variables  
- Reproducible workflows for scientific research  
- Data-driven support for biological studies

## 🛠️ R & Spatial Expertise
- **Geospatial Analysis:**  
  Advanced manipulation of `SpatRaster` and `SpatVector` objects using **terra** and **tidyterra** for large-scale spatial data processing.

- **GIS Ecosystem:**  
  Integrated workflows combining **R (terra, sf)** for automated analysis with **QGIS** for spatial validation, vector editing, and final cartographic layouts.

- **Data Wrangling:**  
  Efficient transformation and cleaning of complex biological datasets using the **tidyverse** (`dplyr`, `tidyr`, `purrr`).

- **Statistical Modeling:**  
  Application of statistical models for experimental, ecological, and biotechnological research.

- **Visualization:**  
  Creation of publication-quality figures and maps using **ggplot2** and its extensions.
